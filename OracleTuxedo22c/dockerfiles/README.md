# Introduction

This folder contains the information on how to create a Tuxedo container image based and two examples for how to use [Tuxedo](http://oracle.com/tuxedo) with it.

## To use

1. Into an empty directory:
   * Download the latest Tuxedo (say 12.1.3  or 22.1.0.0.0) Linux 64 bit installer from [OTN](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/tuxedo/downloads/index.html)
   * Download all the files from this GitHub repository to a local directory
   * Drop the downloaded Tuxedo installer to the corresponding version directory
   * Optionally download the latest Tuxedo rolling patch from My Oracle Support
2. In the local directory
   * Execute ``./buildContainerImage.sh -v 12.1.3 -i tuxedo121300_64_Linux_01_x86.zip -s`` to create an image for Tuxedo 12.1.3.  
     or  
   * Execute ``./buildContainerImage.sh -v 22.1.0.0.0 -i tuxedo221000_64_Linux_01_x86.zip -s`` to create an image for Tuxedo 22.1.0.

Notes:

   1. Before you run buildContainerImage.sh, depending on your Tuxedo version, you need to change the above command and installer name. For instance, `tuxedo122200_64_Linux_01_x86.zip` as the installer name for version 12.2.2 or `tuxedo221000_64_Linux_01_x86.zip` as the installer name for version 22.1.0.0.0.
   2. Before you run buildContainerImage.sh, if proxy is needed to access network, you need to set environment variables at first: http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, no_proxy
   3. The base image oracle/serverjre:8 should be built before you run buildContainerImage.sh. To build the base image, you must first download the Oracle Server JRE binary and drop in folder ../OracleJava/java-8 and build that image.
   For more information, visit the [OracleJava](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleJava) folder's [README](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleJava/README.md) file.

    cd ../OracleJava/java-8
    sh build.sh

You should end up with a Container image tagged oracle/tuxedo:`<version>` where version is Tuxedo version number provided to buildContainerImage.sh.
Have fun!
